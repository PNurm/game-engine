Java game-engine using OpenGL

Note 1: that this project is very much incomplete and might never be completed. The aim for this project was to learn concepts of 3D rendering, math, and overall make a game engine that could be used to make a 3D game.

Note 2: A lot of re-inventing the wheel is happening here, and LibGDX is aimed to be used mostly for it's opengl bindings only. For easier portability to different, or standalone opengl library and for learning purposes.
